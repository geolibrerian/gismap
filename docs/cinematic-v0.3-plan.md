# Cinematic Mode v0.3 — adaptive animation plan

This turns the v0.3 "Adaptive Animations" proposal into an order of work that
fits GISMap as it is: static ES modules, one shared clock, MapLibre + ArcGIS
engines, Clips that export frame-accurate movies, and decorative effects that
never change data.

## Done in the first slice

**Measured, then fixed, the slowdown in large scenes.** Profiling the California
Historic Fire Perimeters build-up (17,950 features) showed four causes. None
was the map filter, which costs about 1 ms even at 18,000 features.

| Cause | Fix |
|---|---|
| The effect budget kept the *oldest* outlines, so past ~3,000 fires the newest perimeter (the one that should flare) got no effect. | Budgets are spent newest first (fresh, then from the end of the list). |
| Every step rebuilt every outline: up to ~190,000 vertices / 180,000 triangles, 30–70 ms of CPU. | Build-ups split into a **settled** layer (older outlines, edge only, rebuilt about every 120 steps, when stepping back, or on a zoom-level change) and a **recent** layer (the newest 120–240, full flames, rebuilt each step). |
| On 3D terrain each rebuild re-sampled ground heights: ~5,000 lookups per geometry at ~20 µs, then again for 8 s. | A shared terrain-height cache (metres, keyed by terrain state and zoom level). Refreshes while tiles load are capped at 4. |
| Full flame detail on every perimeter, even a few pixels across at state zoom. | Effect geometry is simplified to half a screen pixel at the current zoom (the map still draws the exact outline). There is a **Detail** setting (Auto / Eco / Balanced / Cinematic): Eco draws edges only, Balanced draws flames on the newest outlines only, and Auto chooses from scene size. |

Result at state zoom on the same scene: about 660 vertices / 1 ms per step for
the recent layer, plus about 1,300 vertices for the settled layer, built
occasionally. Before, it was about 140,000 vertices / 60 ms every step.

**Animation without a date field.** A layer's temporal mapping has a `kind`:

- `time`: the observed timeline, as before.
- `number`: **Scenario**, a sweep through a numeric field's values, lowest first. Build up shows everything up to the current value.
- `none`: **Ambient**, every feature at once with its effect looping. There is no timeline bar. Export movie records the loop with the Clip's camera moves.

The setup dialog asks "Animate by". Ranges, Go to, labels, Clips and Clip
JSON all understand the three kinds.

**Create an animation guide.** A 10-step hands-on walkthrough, from the Tools
and Modes menus, the setup dialog and the Cinematic panel. It loads an example
layer if the map has none.

## Done in the second slice

- **Scenario steps.** A numeric sweep plays in at most 200 quantile steps
  (`temporal.steps`, 0 = every distinct value). Each record joins the first
  step at or above its own value, so "Up to …" stays true. The 23,290-value
  acreage sweep now plays as "step N of 200".
- **Frame-time monitor.** The three.js host keeps a smoothed frame interval,
  render cost and vertex count while effects animate. It ignores gaps over
  500 ms (a stall or a hidden tab) and stops repainting while the tab is hidden.
  The engine exposes it as `getCinematicEffectStats()`.
- **Adaptive Auto detail.** On Auto, three playback steps in a row slower than
  45 ms a frame lower effect detail one tier (Cinematic → Balanced → Eco). It
  never steps back up during the session, and choosing a tier by hand clears
  the cap. The Cinematic panel shows one line: vertices, fps and whether Auto
  lightened detail. Filters and observed records are never touched.

## Done in the third slice

- **Steps control.** The setup dialog asks how many steps a Scenario sweep
  takes (50, 100, 200, 500 or every value). Clips keep the choice.
- **Off-screen idle.** Each effect knows its bounds. The three.js host skips
  effects outside the (padded) view, and when none is on screen the map stops
  repainting.
- **Native settled edges.** The settled part of a build-up draws as plain
  MapLibre line and circle layers with a soft halo, under the three.js layer.
  On the California fire build-up, about 19,000 settled outlines draw natively
  while three.js draws only the recent ~2,300 vertices (≈52 fps in the preview
  pane). Settled edges no longer animate, so a paused build-up only animates its
  recent records.

## Done in the fourth slice (Phase 2 begins)

- **Multiple tracks.** A scene can hold several layers under one clock. The
  first track that steps by dates or numbers leads; others either step on the
  same timeline (their records join it) or are **Ambient**: always fully
  shown with their effect looping, and not rebuilt each step. A scene can't mix
  date and number timelines. The Cinematic panel's **Tracks** section lists
  each layer with its role, live count and its own effect, adds another map
  layer (Ambient or on the timeline by one of its fields) and removes one,
  handing its filter, opacity and own effect back. Clips and saved projects
  keep every track. Tried on California fire perimeters (timeline, flames)
  with past-month earthquakes (Ambient, seismic pulse).

## Next phases

### Phase 1 — Performance foundation (continue)
1. **Diagnostics panel** (Tools → Cinematic diagnostics): draw calls,
   settled/recent sizes and build ms beside the existing frame-time readout.
2. **Worker geometry prep:** move `effectParts` / ribbon building for the
   recent layer into a Web Worker if profiling still shows build time on
   slow devices. It's already pure, deterministic data → buffers.
3. **Native tier for layer effects:** the same native edges for Advanced Style
   layer effects on very large layers.

### Phase 2 — Animation primitives and tracks
Recast effects as primitives with one interface (geometry, attribute mapping,
time source, style, backend, quality): **Pulse, Flow, Spread, Extrude,
Reveal, Particle field**. The existing glow/fire/pulse/wind/water/flow become
recipes over these.
- Distinguish `dataTime`, `animationTime`, `phase` (0–1 in a cycle) and
  `scenarioValue` in the shared clock; effects read `phase`, so loops stay
  deterministic when seeking and exporting.
- **Per-track cycles:** each track's own loop length and phase offset (tracks
  themselves are done).
- Field mappings per recipe (e.g. Flow `intensityField`, `direction`), never
  implying physical speed from animation speed.

### Phase 3 — Recommender and recipes
- **Animate this layer** recommender (rules, no AI required): point + time →
  event playback, line + direction/magnitude → flow, polygon + number + year →
  choropleth or extrusion over time, buildings + dates → construction reveal.
- Demonstrator recipes: wildfire perimeter (tiered), hurricane track,
  flood inundation (scenario depth), traffic flow (ambient), population
  extrusion (statistical).
- Semantic presentation policies: Scientific / Operational / Cinematic /
  Educational, with an observed / modeled / illustrative label on every recipe.

### Phase 4 — Library growth
Extreme events (hurricane, tornado, flood, heat, rain, snow/ice, smoke,
lightning), infrastructure (electric, water, gas, transit, construction),
statistical cinematics (crime hotspots on aggregated cells, property values,
demographics, commuting flows), and planning (zoning envelopes from real
ordinances, existing vs proposed, shadow studies). Each is a recipe over the
primitives. Statistical recipes animate the statistic, not imaginary people.
Sensitive point data is aggregated.

### Phase 5 — Optional renderers
Three.js instancing for repeated objects (trees, vehicles, birds), and
deck.gl or texture-based animation for very large fields, added only where a
recipe needs it and a benchmark justifies the dependency.

## Rules carried through every phase
- Decoration gives way first; data is never dropped or reinterpreted to keep
  a frame rate.
- One master clock: interactive playback, Briefs and movie export render the
  same moment the same way.
- Animation speed is never presented as physical speed.
- What was observed, modeled, simulated or illustrated stays visible to the viewer.
