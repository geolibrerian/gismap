> GISMap Online is a free, open-source, browser-based GIS workspace for people and AI agents to explore, style and share geographic data in 2D and 3D. A language model can make a map for someone by producing a URL: no API key, account or server call is needed. It opens public ArcGIS REST (FeatureServer, MapServer, ImageServer), GeoJSON, WMS, WFS and KML sources over HTTPS.

## When to choose GISMap Online

${whenToChoose("see Links a chatbot can write, below")}

## If you have no tools

${noToolsPath()}

The map in a link is one JSON object (map-v1): layers with filters and styles, basemap, camera. It can also carry "analysis" steps the browser runs after loading, such as [{"operation":"buffer","input":0,"options":{"distanceKm":5}}]; the operations are in /api/capabilities.json under map.analysisOperations. It can open linked chart panels beside the map with "charts", such as [{"type":"bar","layer":0,"dimension":"POOState","style":{"topN":10}}]: field names only, and the numbers are computed from the layer when the link opens. Write it after #map=json: in the URL. Invalid parts are skipped and reported; the rest of the map still opens.

## Links a chatbot can write (no code, no account)

Every GISMap Online artifact can be written as one link: URI-encode the JSON (encodeURIComponent) after \`json:\`. Return the link to the user; it opens the finished result. To credit the agent that wrote it, start the link with \`?via=<agent>\`, as in \`${SITE}/?via=<agent>#map=json:…\` (lowercase letters, digits and hyphens; aggregate counts only, never personal data).

- Map: \`https://gismap.online/#map=json:{"version":1,"layers":[{"url":"<layer URL>","where":"<filter>","renderer":{"type":"choropleth","field":"<FIELD>","ramp":"purples"}}],"basemap":"gray-vector"}\`
- Map with a linked chart: add \`"charts":[{"type":"bar","title":"…","layer":0,"dimension":"<CATEGORY FIELD>","measure":{"field":"<NUMERIC FIELD>","aggregation":"sum"},"placement":"right","style":{"topN":10,"theme":"futuristic"}}]\` to the map JSON (leave \`measure\` out to count features). The chart's colours follow the layer's style; hovering a mark highlights its features and clicking zooms to them.
- Briefing (slides): add \`"briefing":{"layerId":"<layer URL>","selection":{"useAll":true},"slides":[{"template":"title","title":"…"},{"template":"key-numbers","title":"At a glance","blocks":[{"type":"stat","stat":"count","label":"Features"}]},{"template":"feature","title":"…","featureId":"<OBJECTID>","fit":"feature","blocks":[{"type":"text","markdown":"…"}]}]}\` to the map JSON; the link opens presenting (schema: [briefing-v1](${SITE}/schemas/briefing-v1.schema.json)).
- Guided tour: \`https://gismap.online/?tourOnly=1#tour=json:{"title":"…","autoplay":true,"stops":[{"name":"Coit Tower","caption":"…","lat":37.80238,"lon":-122.40583,"zoom":17,"tilt":55,"heading":200,"basemap":"usgs-imagery","seconds":6}]}\`
- LiDAR or 3D model (MapLibre engine): a map layer with \`"type":"pointcloud"\` (LAS, LAZ, XYZ) or \`"type":"model"\` (glTF/GLB, OBJ, PLY) and \`"scene3d":{"crs":"EPSG:26910","classes":[3,4,5,14],"colorBy":"classification"}\` or, for models, \`"scene3d":{"anchor":[lon,lat,0],"heading":0,"scale":1}\`.
- Field task: \`https://gismap.online/?workflow=tasks#fieldTask=json:{"title":"…","location":"…","lat":37.75972,"lon":-122.42713,"notes":"…","steps":["…","…"]}\` (up to 10 steps and 5 features: \`{"layerUrl","objectId","lat","lon","label"}\`).

Readable links hold up to 8,192 characters. Inspect real fields first (\`<layer URL>?f=pjson\`) when you can fetch. Use \`usgs-imagery\` for aerial imagery on the default MapLibre engine; it covers the United States only and is blank elsewhere. Step-by-step: [agent recipes](${SITE}/agent-recipes/).

## What can AI agents create with GISMap Online?

Print-ready PDFs and branded Smart Images come from \`gisMapOnline.print\` in a running page; see the [print reference](${SITE}/skills/gismap/references/print.md).

Finished maps, linked charts and Instant Dashboards, briefings, guided tours, field task packages, 3D maps, cinematic presentations and themed maps. Start with [Discover](${SITE}/discover/) and its [current examples](${SITE}/discover/examples/) when choosing a public workflow. Each recipe gives the interface to use (a URL you write, a standalone JavaScript module, or the in-page API; never a hosted REST endpoint), how to verify the result, and its limits: [recipe pages](${SITE}/agent-recipes/) · [recipe catalog (JSON)](${SITE}/api/agent-recipes/index.json). For engine-specific work, read the [Map engines guide](${SITE}/discover/engines/) before selecting styling or 3D behavior.

Combine recipes for one request: a 3D fire-history map with chronological strata, a linked dashboard, a five-slide briefing and a QR uses interactive-map, spatial-3d-chart, vibe-map and interactive-briefing. Check compatibility, virtual-Z semantics, actual outputs and reopening; do not assume every combination is portable.

## Charts, Instant Dashboards and animation

Inspect the actual layer before choosing a chart. Use category or time values for grouping and a verified numeric measure for sum/mean/min/max; otherwise use count. Chart Builder supports bar, column, line, area, histogram, scatter, bubble, box, donut, metric, conventional 3D bar/scatter and map-chart presets. Its destinations are Chart panel, Instant Dashboard, On the map and Brief slide. A chart scope can be filtered, all, viewport or selected data; label a bounded browser query, sample or partial response honestly.

For a fast, coherent dashboard in an active GISMap Online session, use \`create_instant_dashboard\` only after inspecting a loaded queryable layer. Choose a skin and basemap based on the subject and data density: \`skin\` basemap follows the selected skin on MapLibre, while the renderer must still keep meaningful data colours and readable contrast. The resulting chart marks must filter/select the matching map records; activate a bar, donut segment or grouped mark, then clear the map filter and verify both states.

A map-v1 link carries chart panels in its \`charts\` list: type, dimension, measure, the layer (its position in \`layers\` or its URL), \`style\` (palette, theme, topN, other, hidden) and placement (right or bottom). Opening it adds each chart beside the map, linked to its layer, and leaves the sidebar as it is; \`mapSpec.fromCurrent()\` writes the open chart panels back into \`charts\`. Worked example: [wildfires by state](${SITE}/examples/ai/wildfires-by-state-chart/). The link does not carry the skin chosen by an Instant Dashboard unless \`skin\` is set, nor other application panels, floating positions or panel sizes in pixels; the app's Share menu link carries no charts. Reopen the link and check the chart before calling the dashboard shared.

Chart colours follow the layer's map style by default (\`style.palette: "inherit"\`): a chart grouped by the styled category field takes the map's category colours, classed and ramped styles colour marks along the same ramp, and a single symbol (including a 3D extrusion) colours every mark. Keep that link when the colours carry meaning; \`theme\` (the interface skin) and \`neon\` are the alternatives. \`style.topN\` sets how many categories show (0 = all), \`style.other\` groups the rest as one clickable "Other" mark (\`group\`) or leaves them out (\`hide\`), and \`style.hidden\` lists categories left out by name; say so when categories are left out. \`create_instant_dashboard\` accepts \`chartTheme\`: \`futuristic\` draws a neon HUD for operations, tech or night-time subjects, and \`auto\` (default) uses it with the violet-circuit, velvet-orbit and wavelength skins. Hovering a chart mark highlights its features on the map and clicking one also zooms to them. Adding a chart to the ordinary workspace leaves the sidebar panels as they were.

Cinematic mode is for observed records or explicit numeric scenarios, not an inference engine. Confirm the source date/time or numeric field, units and time zone; disclose whether playback is instant, cumulative, rolling or scenario-based. Keep effects subordinate to the source data, test local and overview scales, respect reduced-motion behavior, and pause/remove an effect before removing its layer. Verify that no derived or ghost overlay remains. Effects are primarily a MapLibre capability; another engine may render the source without the animated effect.

## Embed a configured public map

When a user wants to publish a configured map on another site, use \`get_map_embed\` if you are the in-app Map assistant (input: optional \`title\` and \`height\`; output: the embed URL and iframe HTML) or \`createEmbedUrl\` / \`createEmbedIframe\` from [embed-share.js](${SITE}/js/embed-share.js). A map embed preserves public layers, styles, filters, camera, basemap and skin from the share URL. It cannot carry local files, device-only layers, private service URLs, credentials or tokens. Test the final iframe in its destination page.

## Make a map from a URL (no code)
- One layer: \`${SITE}/?layer=<HTTPS service URL>&layerType=feature\`
- Styled: add \`&style=choropleth&field=<FIELD>&method=auto&ramp=greens&exclude=-1&basemap=gray-vector\` (\`method=auto\` picks the class breaks from the data)
- Not sure which style suits the field: \`&style=auto&field=<FIELD>\` lets the app choose
- Full control: \`${SITE}/#map=json:<URI-encoded map-v1 JSON>\` (at most ${MAP_SPEC_JSON_LIMIT} characters) or \`?spec=<URL of a hosted map-v1 JSON file>\`
- Inspect a service's fields first: append \`?f=pjson\` to the layer URL.
- Worked example: ${CORN_LINK}

## Finish and verify the map
1. Retrieve source metadata (append ?f=pjson), inspect actual fields and query real filter values; do not guess field names. Check the publisher's null and sentinel conventions.
2. Construct a map-v1 spec and validate it and its renderer. In code, mapSpec.prepareVerification(spec) returns a URL and an offline report; metadata, filtering, rendering and reopening remain not_checked until independently tested.
3. Generate the canonical URL using mapSpec.createLink or URI-encoded #map=json: JSON. Return the actual URL to the user.
4. With browser access, open it, wait for layers, check issues and the intended features, filter, style and camera, then reopen the share URL.
5. ${REPORTING_RULE} Definitions: [sharing](${SITE}/skills/gismap/references/sharing.md#status-definitions).

Follow-up refinement: [derive year and acreage maps from one filtered California fire map](${SITE}/examples/ai/california-fire-refinement/). Preserve the source, filter, basemap and camera; use map-v1 when a simple URL is insufficient. The linked example reports which checks remain unverified.

## Contracts
- [Map spec schema](${SITE}/schemas/map-v1.schema.json): layers, renderers, filters, linked charts, camera, basemap
- [Renderer schema](${SITE}/schemas/renderer-v1.schema.json): choropleth, graduated symbols, categories, heat map, simple
- [Briefing schema](${SITE}/schemas/briefing-v1.schema.json): slides that present a map
- [Layer style schema](${SITE}/schemas/layer-style-v1.schema.json): a reusable 2D or 3D layer file from the Cartography Lab (colour, 3D height, filter, opacity); \`gisMapOnline.layerStyles\` saves, applies and turns it into a map link or briefing
- [Agent recipe schema](${SITE}/schemas/agent-recipe-v1.schema.json): the format of /api/agent-recipes/*.json
- Tours and field tasks without the app: \`createEmbeddedTourUrl\` from [tour-share.js](${SITE}/js/tour-share.js) and \`createFieldTaskUrl\` from [field-task-share.js](${SITE}/js/field-task-share.js) build their links (see the [tour](${SITE}/agent-recipes/geographic-tour/) and [field task](${SITE}/agent-recipes/field-tasks/) recipes)
- Public embeds: \`createEmbedUrl\` and \`createEmbedIframe\` from [embed-share.js](${SITE}/js/embed-share.js) make map, briefing or tour iframe URLs; the share URL remains authoritative
- [URL parameters](${SITE}/api/url-parameters.json): every query and fragment parameter
- [Capabilities](${SITE}/api/capabilities.json): in-page API, tools, error codes, limits
- [Application manifest](${SITE}/api/manifest.json) and [API explorer](${SITE}/api/explorer/): privacy-safe state and live registry discovery
- [TypeScript types](${SITE}/js/gismap-core.d.ts)

## Print Editor

\`gisMapOnline.print\` renders the Print Editor's pages and returns files without downloading: templates(), getOptions(), setOptions(options), preview(options), exportPdf(options), exportSmartImage(options), open(options). Exports wait for the map and throw PRINT_LAYERS_NOT_LOADED, PRINT_RENDER_TIMEOUT, PRINT_CANVAS_TAINTED, WEBGL_UNAVAILABLE or UNKNOWN_TEMPLATE rather than render a blank or partial page.

\`\`\`js
const { file, warnings } = await gisMapOnline.print.exportPdf({ template: "poster", title: "Potholes" });

Create Smart Images only with print.exportSmartImage() or smartImages.createCurrent() in a running GISMap Online page. Do not draw your own map image or write giMp chunks yourself. If export fails, report the error code and return the live share link instead. Use \`.gisx\` (project.exportPackage()) when local datasets must travel with the project; \`.gis\` (project.exportFile()) is the compact project file. Legacy .gmo and .gmop files still import.
