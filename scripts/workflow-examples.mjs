// Worked examples of GIS Map Online's other two workflows, guided tours and
// field tasks, as data for the /examples/tours/ and /examples/field-tasks/
// pages. Each link here was opened in the app and checked (every tour chapter's
// view; the task's features, check-in and report); the committed files beside
// each page are what the pages offer, and tests/workflow-examples.test.mjs
// decodes them.
